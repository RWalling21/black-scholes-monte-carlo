# Experimentation with calculating financial derivatives (in this case, option) prices using the Black-Scholes algorithm and Monte-Carlo simulation. 



This repo is *heavily* inspired by [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNdft7460Sg&) monte-carlo implementation on youtube, but I wanted to go a step further and implement the unapproximated black scholes algorithm. 
Black Scholes is a really fascinating pricing algorithm, if you want to use it for yourself I highly recommend [this](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeJXxpEi4UA_WEe2LLE5DmhDdqoz_aiNR) youtube series.
